# [Project] First Term Project
A [group](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12OG4_1Ks9GTVNHLZEERnrHeXM7sPOmajvzzCEsknHoE) consists of four to six people.<br>

9/27 5:30pm: Group forming time: Everyone in the team has to come.<br>
                       We'll give you some tokens X. If you don't get the token, that means you skip the class.<br>

10/4: Roll call: You have to come, in order to score. Right after the roll call time, each group makes a presentation.<br>

The presentation is on how your group will increase your balance to at least 2X at some future time. Possible methods are:
 - You launch an ICO and convince your classmates to give you tokens.
 - Accumulate loyalty points
 - Token economy
 - Quantitative trading
 - DeFi
 - You gain people's trust using Staking Economy
 - Co-invest
 - STO
 - Crypto-psychology
 - ...

You need to first explain your method in details. For example, if you choose DeFi, you need to have a few slides explain DeFi first. Don't just say you are going to make money.
We first and foremost want to see if you understand the basic concept well. After all, this is the first-term project.

Each team's presentation is 10-minute long, followed by Q&A.
